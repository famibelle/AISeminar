## **Part 2 – Practical workshops (1h30)**

**Objective:** to reflect on the concrete challenges and added value of AI
**Groups:** 3–5 participants

### **Workshops offered**

- RAG and technical documentation (STT + semantic search)
- **Legacy code: documentation, maintenance, and transposition**
- AI-assisted mechanical design
- Software specifications and deviation matrices
- Virtual sensors and indirect estimation (temperature, pressure, torque, real effort)
- Thermal monitoring and fading (Vehicle Dynamics Control)
  *Function:* monitors sensors and applies brake force to individual wheels
- Testing: new testing scenarios, reduction of tests
