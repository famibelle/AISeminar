## 🔍 RAG and Technical Documentation

**Sample Challenge:**  
Engineers lose time searching for specific details in massive technical documentation.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What kind of documents are most critical but hard to use today?  
- How could AI improve the retrieval or understanding of this documentation?  
- What risks (e.g., outdated info, hallucinations) should be managed?  

---

## 💻 Legacy Code: Documentation & Maintenance

**Sample Challenge:**  
Old software lacks documentation, making maintenance slow and error-prone.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Which parts of legacy code are the hardest to maintain?  
- How could AI help document, refactor, or test this code?  
- How to ensure correctness and trust in AI-generated documentation?  


---

## ⚙️ AI-assisted Mechanical Design

**Sample Challenge:**  
Mechanical engineers spend hours iterating designs before reaching feasible solutions.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Which design steps are repetitive or bottlenecks today?  
- How could AI suggest or optimize design alternatives?  
- How would validation and safety be ensured?  


---

## 📊 Software Specifications & Deviation Matrices

**Sample Challenge:**  
Specification mismatches are detected late, causing costly rework.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Which specifications are most prone to inconsistencies?  
- How could AI highlight deviations or missing requirements early?  
- What data or tools would be required to integrate this solution?  


---

## 🌡️ Virtual Sensors & Indirect Estimation

**Sample Challenge:**  
Not all physical variables can be measured directly in vehicles.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Which measurements are most costly or impossible to capture directly?  
- How could AI models estimate these signals reliably?  
- How would accuracy and safety validation be performed?  


---

## 🚗 Thermal Monitoring & Vehicle Dynamics

**Sample Challenge:**  
Thermal issues and dynamics interactions are complex and hard to predict in real time.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Which vehicle behaviors or thermal conditions are hardest to monitor?  
- How could AI improve prediction or early warning systems?  
- What would be the impact on safety, performance, or cost?  


---

## 🧪 Testing Optimization & Simulation Enhancement

**Sample Challenge:**  
Testing processes are long and expensive, with duplicated or redundant simulations.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Which test phases take the most time and resources?  
- How could AI propose optimized test cases or simulation scenarios?  
- How to ensure AI doesn’t miss critical edge cases?
